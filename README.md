# About

This repository hosts information related to an introduction to version control and GitHub, which is part of the DSI bootcamp for the [Master of Science in Data Science](http://records.ureg.virginia.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=44&poid=5490).

# Schedule

The first version of the class took place on July 7 from 9 am till 12 pm EDT in [Dell Classroom 105](http://its.virginia.edu/labs/displayClassroom.php?cId=33). For details, see the [schedule](schedule.md).

# Technical requirements

Participants should bring along a laptop or other device on which they can store, install and compute and that has a modern web browser. If you have made it through the R and Python classes during the DSI bootcamp, you are probably good to go.

# Practice

The repo will also serve as a testing ground during the event, by way of the [exercises](exercises.md) and [issues](https://github.com/UVA-DSI/git-intro/issues). 

# Demo repo

To try things out, use the demo repo over at https://github.com/UVA-DSI/potatoes .

# Reading

A list of things to read in preparation for the event can be found in [readings.md](readings.md).
